# OSI and TCP/IP Model Map
This is an infographic I constructed mapping out the layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models, along with technologies that relate to each at their respective layers. It is far from exhaustive, but has become a useful reference for me as I continue to learn about networking communications. 

If you would like to have your own copy to edit, I here is a link to an editable copy on Canva. (It does require that you have a Canva account.)
